> * Consul (registration center\configuration center)
> > * docker run -d --name=consul -p 8500:8500 -v $PWD/data/:/consul/data/ \\  
      -e 'CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG={"skip_leave_on_interrupt":true,"telemetry":{"disable_compat_1.9":true}}' \\  
      consul:1.11 agent -server -ui -bootstrap -client='0.0.0.0'

### Component description

> * External requests uniformly access internal services through Spring Cloud Gateway
> * After the gateway receives the request, it obtains the available services from Consul
> * The gateway performs user authentication, then forwards the user information to the backend, and re-encapsulates the return value from the backend
> * All service traffic is controlled using Sentinel
> * Communication between microservices through RestTemplate
> * Consul for unified management of service configuration
> * Usage information of Spring Cloud Sleuth monitoring service
> * Zipkin monitors call information between services
> * Spring Boot Admin monitors the running status and properties of services and other related information
> * The service integrates unified exception management, authority authentication, i18n, liquibase
